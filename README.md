# What is BigChat?

It's a generator of plain text with emoticons! Just the other way around of how we create emoticons with text!
Example:

That's just another way to say hi :)

# How do I build and run BigChat from Eclipse?
Import cloned project into Eclipse workspace as a Java project.
Then import swt into your workspace. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_configure_an_Eclipse_Java_project_to_use_SWT%3F to find how.

Now you run the main method.
After the application runs you can write your words in the big text field which should be "emotified" with emoticons selected or written in Padding and Writing dropdown boxes and copied to your clipboard already! Just Ctrl + v in a relevant chat application to see the result!
